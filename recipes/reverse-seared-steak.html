      <h4>This is my way to make steaks with medium rare insides with accessable cookware</h4>
      <p>For the longest time in my life, I could never understand the facination with steak. Every time I tried to cook it, my steaks would come out chewey and a dull gray color inside. I had it in my mind that steaks were always like that, so the high prices at resturants never made sense to me.</p>
      <p>It was when I first started working in the resturant industry that I got to watch a chef make a steak and explain the process, and how they got the steak to be so flavourful and pleasurable to eat.</p>
      <p>This recipe was made from countless times of trial and error myself and the advice and guidence of chefs I have worked with, to try and make resturant quality steaks at home (for half the price).</p>
      <P>A Good idea to increase the crisp on the steak exterior is to dry brine the steak, which is to cover the steak liberally in salt and pepper and leave it on a cooling rack overnight in the fridge.</P>
      <p><strong>Recipe List</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cut of Steak, 1 1/2 to 2 inches thick</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Recipe Instructions</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Generously season steak(s) all over with salt and pepper. If desired, set steak(s) on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, overnight to dry out the exterior. Otherwise, proceed with the next step.</li>
        <li>Set steak(s) on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Preheat oven to anywhere between 200 and 275°F (93 and 135°C); if your oven goes lower, you can set it to an even lower temperature, though it will take longer to cook.</li>
        <li>Place steak(s) in the oven and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 105°F (41°C) for rare, 115°F (46°C) for medium-rare, 125°F (52°C) for medium, or 135°F (57°C) for medium-well. This will take about 20 minutes for rare steak and up to about 40 minutes for medium-well; cooking time can vary dramatically depending on many factors, so check often.</li>
        <li>Just before steak(s) come out of the oven, add 1 tablespoon (15ml) butter to a cast iron, carbon steel, or heavy stainless steel skillet and heat over high heat until smoking. Add steak(s) and butter to skillet and cook until each side is well browned, about 45 seconds per side. Using tongs, hold steak(s) sideways to sear edges. Serve right away; there's no need to let reverse-seared steaks rest.</li>

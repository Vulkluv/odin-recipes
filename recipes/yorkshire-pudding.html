      <p><h4>Yorkshire pudding is a savoury mixture of eggs, flour, and milk. It is a well recognized British side dish and can be served alongside any food.</h4></p>
      <p>Back in my childhood I have fond memories of large family celebrations with huge roasts and lively conversations. I was a quit kid however, and I knew what I was there for. When everyone would be discussing the ongoing buisness of their lives I would be in the kitchen with my aunt and monther, asking them questions about what they were making and if I could taste test it for them. The highlight of the evening for me would be the Yrokshire pudding, I would eat as many as I could without being caught, and when I was older and had the ability to cook myself there were a few shameful nights where a full batch would just be made for myself.</p>
      <p>Yorkshire pudding goes back as far as the 18th century and has been a part of my family as far as I can remember. Today I would like to share my own recipe for Yorkshire pudding in the hopes that, like me, you will love it enough to not share it with anyone.</p>
      <p>The most important part of this recipe is letting the batter rest overnight before baking, it will add a lot of moisture to the recipe and is well worth the wait.</p>
      <p>Adding MSG is optional as some people do not react well to it, but it is a secret weapon in increasing the savoury taste of the dish.</p>
      <p><strong>Recipe List</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 Large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup + 2 teaspoons baking flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup 2% milk</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon msg</li>
        <li>1 + 1/2 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup lard / beef drippings / melted butter</li>
      </ul>
      <p><Strong>Recipe Instructions</Strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine eggs, flour, milk, water, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk until a smooth batter is formed. Let batter rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Alternatively, for best results, transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate batter overnight or for up to 3 days. Remove from refrigerator while you preheat the oven.</li>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Divide drippings (or other fat) evenly between two 8-inch cast iron or oven-safe non-stick skillets, two 6-well popover tins (see notes), one 12-well standard muffin tin, or one 24-well mini muffin tin. Preheat in the oven until the fat is smoking hot, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pans or tins to a heat-proof surface (such as an aluminum baking sheet on your stovetop), and divide the batter evenly between every well (or between the two pans if using pans). The wells should be filled between 1/2 and 3/4 of the way (if using pans, they should be filled about 1/4 of the way). Immediately return to oven. Bake until the yorkshire puddings have just about quadrupled in volume, are deep brown all over, crisp to the touch, and sound hollow when tapped. Smaller ones will take about 15 minutes, popover- or skillet-sized ones will take around 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, or cool completely, transfer to a zipper-lock freezer bag, and freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat in a hot toaster oven before serving.</li>

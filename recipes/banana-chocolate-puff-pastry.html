      <p>In my journey to eating healthier foods, I came across the realization that I have to stop learning to bake desserts. As much as you workout, it is impossible to overcome the calories consumed by a dessert madeup of all of your favourite sweet things.</p>
      <p>This recipe is originally from Half Baked Harvest, but I add chopped walnuts to the recipe and prebake the bananas to ensure maximum sweetness. I could hardly get past 1/8 of it before I had to reconsider my dietary choices and packaged it up to give away.</p>
      <p>The recipe is absolutely beyond delcious, but for your own health please make sure that you have someone to share with before you end up eating it all.</p>
      <p>Prior to beginning, bake bananas at 400 for about 10 minutes to enhance their sweetness, even if already ripened.</p>
      <p><strong>Recipe List</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 frozen puff pastry box, unfrozen</li>
        <li>200g milk chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 bananas</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 handfull of roasted walnuts, roughly chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425F</li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pasty into roughly the size of your baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Using a knife, score a crust around the edge of the puff pastry. Using a fork, poke holes into the center piece inside the crust to stop the inside from rising during baking.</li>
        <p><i>For the next few steps, assemble your puff pastry inside of the baking pan you plan to bake in to reduce any chance of mess.</i></p>
        <li>Spread chocolate over the entirety of the inside of the puff pastry, putting bananas on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle walnuts and honey over the chocolate and bananas, making sure to get some "accidentally" on the crust.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, untill the edges are golden brown and the bananas have begun caramalizing.</li>
      </ol>
